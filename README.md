The goal of this project is to create a Rock Paper Scissors game where the user plays 5 games versus a computer's randomly generated choices of rock, paper, or scissors. The program will keep score and declare a winner at the end of the game.

The purpose is to create and utilize Javascript functions that will accomplish this task. Initially, the program will be played entirely on the browser console.
